# CEQ Library
C# library for making basic sound.

## Why though?
Honestly, I haven't got a clue.

## Any examples?
There's sandstorm.ceq, which you can play with the CEQ player.

## How to use
Download the latest release of Ceq.dll, include it with your project, and use the Ceq.Main.Play() function to play a file.
